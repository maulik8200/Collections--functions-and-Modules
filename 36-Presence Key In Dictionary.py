# Q.36 How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary?

# -->You can check if a key exists in the dictionary in Python using the keys() method of the dictionary class.
#    The keys() method returns a view object of keys (something similar to a collection) in which you can search for the required key using the in operator we saw earlier.
